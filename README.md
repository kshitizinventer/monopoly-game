# monopoly-game

This is my take on the classic monopoly game with all the classic features i.e buying prooperties paying rent etc.
But it also contains a bank from which you can take loans.
Your credit limit increases with your networth which is a function of your total wealth, properties and general rent earned on your
properties.

The most interesting thing is there is a publicly available stock market in the game in which you can issue public shares of your
company to bank and people can buy stocks from there.

Also the property net value is not stagnant rather increases or decreases with respect to total properties built and frequency of rent
etc.
